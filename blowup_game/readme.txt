1. Insight on simulation dashboards
Simulation dashboards are great planning and analysis tools and can be created for various scenarios. They help give a quick overview of a simulation/scenario

2. Experience with D3
We found D3 to be a powerful tool to create interesting visualizations.
There was a bit of learning curve initially, especially due to none of us having much experience with JavaScript.
After that, the documentation for D3 was quite helpful and had plenty of examples.

3. Using $100,000
If I had $100,000, I would bet about 20% of my money in each of the 20 trials. From fiddling with the sliders, it looks like the chances of 3-5x your money is the highest and I would be content with those winnings rather than making the highest amount possible.
